My runner-up prize Windows Phone application in Hackathon 2014.
It's about using QR code to share contact more quickly and effeciently.
Moreover, it updates friends' contact (who also use this app, and agree to share their changed information) automatically. So you don't have to tell everyone about your new contact everytime you change it.
